# Playwright MCP Automation Server  

This project integrates **Playwright** with the **MCP (Modular Command Protocol)** framework to enable web automation and testing through natural language or programmatic interaction. It allows you to:  
- Open websites and extract information.  
- Click elements and perform actions.  
- Take screenshots.  
- Generate test cases.  
- Create JSON test reports.  

You can prompt tools like **Claude** (or any other LLM) to perform browser automation, generate tests, and provide feedback.

## Features  
- Web Automation: Interact with websites using Playwright.  
- Test Case Generation: Create automated test scripts.  
- Screenshots: Capture web pages for reporting.  
- JSON Reports: Save test outcomes for analysis.

## Stopping the Server  
Press **CTRL+C** to stop the MCP server.

## Extending the Project  
You can create additional tools by adding more `@mcp.tool()` functions to the **playwright_mcp.py** file.  

For example:  

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def get_url(page_url: str) -> str:
    """Returns the current URL."""
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.chromium.launch(headless=False)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto(page_url)
        current_url = page.url
        await browser.close()
        return current_url
```
